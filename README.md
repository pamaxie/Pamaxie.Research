# Pamaxie.Research
### It is with a hard feeling in our heart, that we have to announce, that Pamaxie as a project is cancelled. Due to lacking funds and massive changes in the project owners life (Leejja) we currently no longer have the financial or time capacity to maintain it which is why we think it is best that we close this chapter of our life. We are sorry that we could not live up to our promises. We are looking into a cheap way to host our dataset. If possible we may update this page. Due to concerns for the public we might not however (there is some graphic imagry in there which may be quite disturbing or problematic to release)
Here official research for Pamaxie is stored until its publically released.
This contains training parameters, webcrawlers we use for getting our image data and other information.
Please remember this repository and everything in it is supposed to be kept private to prevent legal problems with licensing theft in the future.
