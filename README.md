# Pamaxie.Research
### We have started development again. This is a long process and will take a while to get rolling. For now we will focus mostly on our web presence to drive more traffic to the project.
Here official research for Pamaxie is stored until its publically released.
This contains training parameters, webcrawlers we use for getting our image data and other information.
Please remember this repository and everything in it is supposed to be kept private to prevent legal problems with licensing theft in the future.
